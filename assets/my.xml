Each one is 100 mm width. The top one is 40 mm height. The second one is 50 mm height. The third one is 60 mm height. The point of this page is to use it when testing threaded text frames. Unfortunately it is currently quite buggy in the WYSIWYG editor. Hopefully, with the help of this template, the bugs will be fixed and threaded text frames will work in the editor as well as they work in InDesign.</Content>				<Br/>				<Content>Good luck to the developers who work on the tickets related to threaded text frames.</Content>			</CharacterStyleRange>		</ParagraphStyleRange>
